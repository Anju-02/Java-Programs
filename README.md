# Java-Programs
This repository contains Java programming assignments designed to strengthen understanding of core concepts such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, multithreading, JDBC, and algorithms.

## Assignments Overview
# 1. Polymorphism with Shape Interface
- Description: Implements polymorphism by defining a `Shape` interface with methods to calculate the area and perimeter. Classes like `Circle` and `Triangle` implement the interface.
- Key Concepts: Polymorphism, Interfaces, OOP.

# 2. Invoking Parent Class Constructor
- Description: Demonstrates invoking a parent class constructor from a child class. The program uses inheritance to showcase constructor chaining.
- Key Concepts: Constructor Chaining, Inheritance.

# 3. Exception Handling with Negative Number
- Description: Takes an integer input from the user and throws a custom exception if the input is negative. Demonstrates exception handling.
- Key Concepts: Custom Exceptions, Try-Catch Blocks.
  
# 4. Bank Account Simulation
- Description: Simulates a bank account with functionalities like deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.
- Key Concepts: Encapsulation, Class Methods.

# 5. Abstract Class vs Interface
- Description: Demonstrates the differences between abstract classes and interfaces using programs and key points.
- Key Concepts: Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Inheritance.

# 6. Binary Search Algorithm
- Description: Implements a binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array. Returns the index or an appropriate message.
- Key Concepts: Algorithms, Recursion.

# 7. Multithreading: Even and Odd Numbers
- Description: Creates two threads. The first thread prints even numbers, while the second thread prints odd numbers between 1 and 10.
- Key Concepts: Multithreading, Runnable Interface.

# 8. Finding Second Largest and Second Smallest Elements
- Description: Reads integers from the user into a list and finds the second largest and second smallest elements.
- Key Concepts: Collections, List Manipulation.

# 9. JDBC: Connecting to MySQL Database
- Description: Connects to a MySQL database using JDBC. Reads data from a table and displays the results in the console.
- Key Concepts: JDBC, Database Connections, SQL.


# Key Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.
- Error Handling: Exception Handling with Try-Catch Blocks.
- Multithreading: Creating and managing threads.
- Data Structures: Using Lists and Arrays.
- Database Connectivity: Connecting Java applications to MySQL using JDBC.
- Algorithms: Binary Search.
